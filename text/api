Application Programming Interface is a set of routines, protocols and tools for building software applications. There are a wide range of APIs. In a programming language a library provides functions for the programmer to use. The library API explains how to use these functions for the programmer, so that the programmer don't need to look at the implementation of the functions.

A web API defines the interface through which interactions happen between an enterprise and application that use its assets. For the application to get these assets from the enterprise it has to send a HTTP request over a network. This request has to contain data that uses the web API for the enterprise to understand what asset the application want. When the enterprise has received the HTTP request, it sends back a HTTP response. This HTTP response is usually in XML or JSON format.
